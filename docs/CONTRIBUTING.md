You need to pull the repository, install the dependencies with `node` and then build with the command `npm run dev`. It will automatically move the files into the `docs/test-vault` and hot reload the plugin.

    git clone https://github.com/reMemex/capture-to-obsidian.git
    cd capture-to-obsidian
    npm install
    npm run dev
